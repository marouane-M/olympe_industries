This story is about an exceptional professional whose journey epitomizes growth, expertise, and unwavering commitment, as a woman, in a male-dominant industry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Sonya is a dedicated mother of two teenagers, balancing family life with her passion for fastpitch softball, where she excels as both a first baseman and shortstop. Her love for the game is matched by her commitment to professional excellence, recently being elected as a Director for the Eastern Ontario Chapter of the Canadian Fire Alarm Association (CFAA). This new role reflects her leadership and drive, qualities she brings to all aspects of her life, from the softball field to her professional contributions in fire safety.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"ivm-image-view-model pvs-entity__image \">\n<p>In an interview published by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.casa-firesprinkler.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CASA<\/a> Journal, concerning her career in the construction industry she stated: &#8220;Having a seat at the table in the fire protection industry, alongside both men and women, is a significant step towards greater diversity and inclusion. It not only enriches the industry with a wider range of perspectives and talents but also sends a powerful message that anyone, regardless of gender, can contribute meaningfully to fire and life safety efforts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Photo: Sonya Robinson, Operations Manager Fire Alarm division \u2013 Viking Fire Protection Ottawa<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"display-flex flex-column full-width align-self-center\">\n<div class=\"sjoTiQXsIrHRaOZVCcNpsUnpmNfFurXkMeiWaq pvs-entity__sub-components\">\n<div class=\"BMQQbQbgIDIXbuCJMEYkpUriexATDoZLBuVSA \" data-view-name=\"profile-component-entity\">\n<div class=\"display-flex flex-column full-width align-self-center\">\n<div class=\"display-flex flex-row justify-space-between\">\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9364 size-full\" title=\"Operations Manager A woman in the fire protection industry#1\" src=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/join-the-best-viking-series-7.png\" alt=\"Operations Manager A woman in the fire protection industry#1\" width=\"1200\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/join-the-best-viking-series-7.png 1200w, https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/08\/join-the-best-viking-series-7-300x195.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/08\/join-the-best-viking-series-7-1024x666.png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/08\/join-the-best-viking-series-7-768x499.png.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>The Climb up the Fire Protection Ladder<\/h2>\n<p>Sonya&#8217;s work experience in the fire protection industry began as a coordinator, and with the mentorship and support of her manager, she advanced her career up to a supervisor position.<\/p>\n<p>At Viking Fire, she began working as an Inspections Supervisor: this role helped to shape her understanding of the field, allowing her to develop a meticulous approach to inspections and a deep appreciation for the critical nature of fire protection services. A few years later, Sonya was promoted to her current role: Operations Manager, for the service and inspections department of the fire alarm division.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the foundation for her career was laid at the Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology, where she acquired a Certificate in Business Administration and Management, and, more recently she completed a management program, which provided a solid grounding in business principles, critical thinking, and management strategies: instrumental in her professional achievements.<\/p>\n<h3>A Journey of Passion and Purpose: Insights from an Operations Manager at Viking Ottawa<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Sonya is proud that her career in fire protection, of over twenty years and counting, enables her to make a positive impact by helping clients ensure the safety of their properties, communities, and buildings occupants. The sense of purpose derived from keeping people and property safe is a major motivator. Knowing that her work at Viking Fire directly contributes to the safety and security of the Ottawa community, clients, and their assets, gives her a deep sense of fulfillment.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview published in the 2nd edition of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.casa-firesprinkler.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CASA<\/a> Outstanding Women of The Canadian Fire Sprinkler Industry, Sonya mentioned that the opportunity to collaborate with professionals from diverse trades, including electrical contractors, AHJs (Authorities Having Jurisdiction), engineers, and manufacturers, enriched her work experience. &#8220;This cross-functional collaboration not only broadened my knowledge but also enriched my work experience, as I learned to navigate different perspectives and expertise in the industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Sonya is convinced that building strong relationships with clients and colleagues is fundamental in her line of work: &#8220;What drives me to get up and do this every day is the sense of pride I have in my team and the journey we are on together.
