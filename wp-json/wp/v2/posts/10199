Where is the guide for that? Many of us have responded to a late-afternoon <a href=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/services\/emergency-24-7\/\">service call<\/a> for a trouble condition and thought, &#8220;If only I had step-by-step instructions to locate this ground fault.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong data-start=\"34\" data-end=\"176\">To fill this gap, Thomas Richards, <a href=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/ottawa-office\/\">Viking Fire Ottawa<\/a> Manager, authored a \u201cGuide to Troubleshooting\u201d series published in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfaajournal.ca\/vol-24-issue-4\/article-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFAA Journal<\/a>.<\/strong> This series highlights common <a href=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/solutions\/fire-alarm\/\">fire alarm system<\/a> issues and provides step-by-step guidance for investigating and resolving them.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that fire alarm systems are becoming more complex, with each model and manufacturer varying slightly. Therefore, most of this series will focus on troubleshooting conventional-type circuits. However, the basic troubleshooting skills covered will provide a foundation applicable to all types of systems.<\/p>\n<p>Before you grab your toolkit and tell dispatch to send you to the next ground fault call, let\u2019s start with the basics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr data-start=\"2404\" data-end=\"2407\" \/>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h3><strong>Fire Alarm Systems and Basic Electrical Principles<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Fire alarm systems operate on the basic principles of electricity and Ohm&#8217;s Law. It\u2019s essential to understand these principles and how fire alarm systems are designed to function to apply the troubleshooting techniques described in this series.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10264 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/s241479.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/s241479.png 1000w, https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2025\/07\/s241479-300x169.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2025\/07\/s241479-768x432.png.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<hr data-start=\"2404\" data-end=\"2407\" \/>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>Steps in Troubleshooting Fire Alarm Systems<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Troubleshooting <a href=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/solutions\/fire-alarm\/\">fire alarm<\/a> systems can be broken down into four basic steps:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>1- Preparation<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Preparation for troubleshooting fire alarm systems may seem minor, but is crucial. Having as much information as possible beforehand can be the difference between a quick fix and a prolonged repair. Technicians should develop a habit of asking questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I need specific PPE?<\/li>\n<li>Is special access required?<\/li>\n<li>What details has the customer provided about the trouble? (Depending on the information given, you may want to check your vehicle inventory to ensure you have spare parts specific to the site.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Basic tools required for troubleshooting:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>DMM (Digital Multi Meter)<\/li>\n<li>Ladder<\/li>\n<li>Multi-driver<\/li>\n<li>Wire strippers<\/li>\n<li>Combination pliers (linesman\u2019s)<\/li>\n<li>Various end-of-line resistors (2.2k, 3.9K, 4.7K, 20K, 47K)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Additional tools such as toners or voltage detectors can be helpful. However, for the purposes of this troubleshooting series, the tools listed above are the minimum required.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you arrive on site, introduce yourself to the contact person. Ask questions that may help in the investigation, such as whether any recent work was performed or if there was water infiltration in the building. Inform them that you may need access throughout the building based on your findings. If available, ask for as-built floor plans, as knowing circuit routing can save time.<\/p>\n<p>Before starting, call the central monitoring station to place the system on test and notify the fire department that you\u2019re working on the fire alarm system.<\/p>\n<hr data-start=\"2404\" data-end=\"2407\" \/>\n<h4><strong>2- Identify<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The next step is to identify the system trouble. The type of trouble and the level of detail available will vary depending on the fire alarm system. Older conventional systems may have only status lamps, meaning a few extra steps may be necessary to diagnose the issue. CPU-based fire alarm panels with LCD displays can provide much more detail. As technology evolves, fire alarm systems are becoming more integrated and cloud-based, allowing you to access real-time information via a smartphone or web browser.<\/p>\n<p>For this troubleshooting guide series, we\u2019ll assume we\u2019re working on basic conventional panels with status lamps. The type of trouble will determine the investigation approach\u2014whether it\u2019s a panel-based issue that may require hardware replacement or a circuit integrity issue needing field wiring inspection.<\/p>\n<hr data-start=\"2404\" data-end=\"2407\" \/>\n<h4><strong>3- Investigation<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified the specific trouble type, move to the investigation phase. Troubleshooting fire alarm systems is largely a process of elimination. Ruling out faulty Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP) hardware is a critical first step before investigating field wiring.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Examples:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checking power supplies for charging currents before replacing batteries<\/li>\n<li>Installing end-of-line resistors on input or output circuits to rule out faulty FACP components. If the trouble clears with the appropriate resistor installed at the panel, it indicates the panel components are functional.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the issue lies with field wiring or devices, the process of elimination continues. This series will cover troubleshooting the following common issues:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Power supply troubles<\/li>\n<li>Open circuit on conventional initiating circuits<\/li>\n<li>Open circuit on conventional indicating circuits<\/li>\n<li>Short circuit on conventional initiating circuits<\/li>\n<li>Short circuit on conventional indicating circuits<\/li>\n<li>Ground faults<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10270 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/fire-alarm.webp\" alt=\"fire Alarm\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/fire-alarm.webp 800w, https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/fire-alarm-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/vikingfire.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/fire-alarm-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<hr data-start=\"2404\" data-end=\"2407\" \/>\n<h4><strong>4- Repair<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Once the investigation is complete and the trouble\u2019s cause is identified, plan the repair. It\u2019s essential to inform the customer of your findings before proceeding. Communication between the technician, customer, and office is crucial, as each site may have specific procedures for life safety system maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>Some repairs are straightforward, such as replacing a faulty device or fixing a pinched or broken wire, and can be completed during the initial call. Others may require additional trades, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An electrician to replace a section of wire<\/li>\n<li>A sprinkler fitter to replace fire protection equipment<\/li>\n<li>A plumber or roofer to fix a water leak<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whenever a fire alarm system is serviced, refer to the appropriate ULC standard to ensure the system is inspected or verified to confirm proper operation. For large or complex repairs, it\u2019s strongly recommended to consult with your local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) to determine if a permit is required for the work performed.<\/p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><em><br \/>\nOriginally published in CFAA Journal Vol 4, Issue 4.
