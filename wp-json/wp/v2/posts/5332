I have such a passion for fire<br \/>\nsafety and the fire protection world. It has been my dream to work in fire protection for some time<br \/>\nnow. Thanks to Viking support, I was able to buy the proper laptop I needed this semester to run AutoCAD.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Alissa Carlick<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thank you for your generous donation and selecting me for this award. This award would assist me in purchasing anything necessary for me and my future career, such as safety shoes or any personal protective equipment. I believe that financial support is very important to provide for students as attending school can add up very quickly. Receiving any financial support helps students in being able to purchase the necessary items to be better students.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Kevin Li<\/p>\n<h2>Viking Fire Protection and Seneca College Collaboration<\/h2>\n<p>A leader in fire protection present from coast to coast in Canada, Viking Fire Protection is a loyal partner of the Seneca College Fire Protection Engineering Technology School.<\/p>\n<p>If saving lives and property appeals to you, and if you want a dynamic and rewarding career, consider the field of fire protection.
