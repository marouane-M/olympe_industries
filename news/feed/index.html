										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Fire Protection Services in Ottawa: Your Safety, Our Expertise</strong></h2>
<p>Fire safety isn’t just about ticking boxes for compliance—it’s about real protection for people, businesses, and assets. At Viking Fire Protection Ottawa, we understand the challenges general contractors, building managers, and facility owners face when it comes to fire protection. From navigating strict regulations to ensuring systems work flawlessly in an emergency, fire protection is a responsibility you can’t afford to overlook.</p>
<p>That’s where we come in. With decades of experience and a team of certified fire protection experts, we provide tailor-made solutions to meet the unique needs of your building—whether it’s a commercial high-rise, a healthcare facility, a government building, or an industrial warehouse.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Fire Protection Matters More Than Ever</strong></h3>
<p>In Ottawa’s fast-growing and diverse infrastructure, fire risks are evolving. Building owners and managers must ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong> – Meeting Ontario’s fire codes and <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/for-professionals/codes-and-standards/NFPA-LiNK?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;order_src=G027&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=16534311752&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjws4fEBhD-ARIsACC3d2_F2DoNDBYB64hK1yUNTK5BV0cvJxORmXy7BtiiZwr8EBrNdpnGhlYaAqyjEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFPA standards</a></li>
<li><strong>System Reliability</strong> – Ensuring fire alarms, sprinklers, and suppression systems function when needed</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Business Disruptions</strong> – Avoiding costly shutdowns due to non-compliance or malfunctioning equipment</li>
<li><strong>Life Safety</strong> – Protecting employees, residents, and visitors from fire hazards</li>
</ul>
<p>Ignoring fire safety isn’t an option. Viking Fire Protection Ottawa ensures your building is prepared, compliant, and, most importantly, safe.</p>
<h4><strong>Fire Sprinkler Systems: Your First Line of Defense</strong></h4>
<p>When a fire breaks out, every second counts. A properly installed and maintained fire sprinkler system can mean the difference between a minor incident and a catastrophic loss. We provide:</p>

<div class="sjoTiQXsIrHRaOZVCcNpsUnpmNfFurXkMeiWaq pvs-entity__sub-components">
<div class="BMQQbQbgIDIXbuCJMEYkpUriexATDoZLBuVSA " data-view-name="profile-component-entity">
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Sprinkler System Design</strong> – Wet, dry, pre-action &amp; deluge systems tailored to your facility</li>
<li><strong>Professional Installation &amp; Retrofitting</strong> – Bringing older buildings up to code with modern solutions</li>
<li><strong>Routine Inspections &amp; Maintenance</strong> – Ensuring optimal performance and compliance with NFPA 13</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We work with general contractors and building managers to install fire sprinkler systems seamlessly into both new and existing structures. Whether you need a brand-new system or an upgrade, we’ve got you covered.<a href="https://vikingfire.ca/ottawa-office/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9737" src="https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ottawa-and-brand-campaigns-300x157.png" alt="Fire Protection in Ottawa" width="986" height="516" srcset="https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ottawa-and-brand-campaigns-300x157.png 300w, https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ottawa-and-brand-campaigns-1024x535.png 1024w, https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ottawa-and-brand-campaigns-768x401.png 768w, https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ottawa-and-brand-campaigns.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></p>

</div>
<h4><strong>Portable Fire Extinguishers: Small But Mighty Protection</strong></h4>
<p>Sometimes, a fire can be contained before it spreads—if the right extinguisher is available and properly maintained. Viking Fire Protection Ottawa offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales &amp; Installation</strong> – Extinguishers suited for different fire types (A, B, C, D &amp; K)</li>
<li><strong>Annual Inspections &amp; Recharging</strong> – Ensuring they’re in perfect working condition</li>
<li><strong>Fire Safety Accessories</strong> – Emergency lighting, exit signs, fire cabinets</li>
</ul>
<p>A fire extinguisher is only useful if it works when you need it. We make sure yours are always ready.</p>
<h4><strong>Fire </strong><strong>Alarm &amp; Detection Systems: Stay One Step Ahead</strong></h4>
<p>Would your building occupants be alerted quickly in case of a fire? A reliable fire alarm system is essential for early detection and rapid response. We offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State-of-the-Art Fire Detection</strong> – Smoke, heat, and gas detectors to identify threats early</li>
<li><strong>Addressable &amp; Conventional Alarm Systems</strong> – Designed for small businesses to large commercial buildings</li>
<li><strong>24/7 Monitoring &amp; Testing</strong> – Ensuring continuous functionality and peace of mind</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Sprinklers &amp; Suppression Systems</strong> – A holistic fire protection approach</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid false alarms, faulty systems, or outdated technology—let us evaluate your current setup and recommend the best solutions for your needs.<a href="https://vikingfire.ca/ottawa-office/"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-9743 aligncenter" src="https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fire-alarm-ottawa-2-300x157.png" alt="" width="1013" height="530" srcset="https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fire-alarm-ottawa-2-300x157.png 300w, https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fire-alarm-ottawa-2-1024x535.png 1024w, https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fire-alarm-ottawa-2-768x401.png 768w, https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fire-alarm-ottawa-2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Special Hazard Fire Suppression: Protecting High-Risk Areas</strong></h4>
<p>Not all fires can be put out with water. Some environments—like data centers, industrial sites, or server rooms—require specialized solutions. We provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean Agent Suppression Systems</strong> – Non-damaging solutions ideal for electronics and sensitive materials</li>
<li><a href="https://vikingfire.ca/solutions/special-hazards-systems/"><strong>Foam-Based Suppression</strong></a> – Tailored for industrial and manufacturing applications</li>
<li><strong>Gas Detection &amp; Monitoring Systems</strong> – Proactively identifying fire hazards before ignition</li>
</ul>
<p>If your business operates in a high-risk environment, we’ll design a system that keeps it safe without causing secondary damage.</p>
<h4><strong>Kitchen Fire Suppression: Essential for Ottawa’s Food Industry</strong></h4>
<p>Restaurants and commercial kitchens are at high risk for grease fires, which spread fast and can be devastating. Our fire suppression systems ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic Fire Suppression</strong> – Activates instantly in the presence of a grease fire</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with NFPA 96</strong> – Meeting industry standards and local regulations</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Maintenance &amp; Inspections</strong> – Keeping your system in top condition</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you own a restaurant, a cafeteria, or an industrial kitchen, don’t take fire risks lightly. Protect your staff, customers, and property with Viking’s kitchen fire suppression solutions.</p>
<h4><strong>Compliance &amp; Fire Safety Regulations: We’ve Got You Covered</strong></h4>
<p>Navigating fire safety regulations can feel overwhelming—but that’s why we’re here. Viking Fire Protection Ottawa ensures full compliance with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ontario Fire Code &amp; Building Code Requirements</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ottawa Fire Department Regulations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We stay up to date with the latest changes in fire protection laws so you don’t have to. Let us help you avoid fines, delays, and safety risks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Pairing Modern Sustainability with Viking Fire Protection Expertise</h2>
<p>In the heart the Halifax Regional Municipality, encompassing more than 200 communities across nine distinct regions, an inspiring model of sustainable development is materializing for 2024.</p>
<p>The construction of a new organics management facility, engineered to process 60,000 tons of organic waste annually, will be a significant leap towards a greener, more environmentally conscious future.</p>
<p>In fact, it will meet, and exceed, the NS Environment and Climate Change 2010 Composting Facility Guidelines.</p>
<p>The new cutting-edge plant is strategically designed, and amongst its many modern eco-friendly features, the plant has a water negative system in place, which collects storm water from the site to be repurposed for fire protection.  In fact, this new &#8220;green&#8221; project has its own unique challenges regarding the vital aspects of fire safety.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="https://vikingfire.ca/find-regional-help/">Viking Fire Protection Inc.</a> steps-in; we have the expertise to address these particular safety issues, to safeguard both the facility and its environmental mission.</p>
<p>Our complete range of fire protection services is tailored to safeguard not just property, but also the invaluable work and vision of organizations driving sustainability initiatives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Gabrielle Niessen, Inspection/Service Business Process Manager</em></p>
<h3>Do you know what Mozaik is?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Completely created in-house by our IT department, with the vision of (now retired) André Cote, and improvements recommended from some of the 238 active field users and 100+ office users, Mozaik was built to help improve the management of our Inspection and Service Departments’ work flow and reports. To work alongside the Mozaik program, many service modules were added to PolyApps for creating and dispatching Inspection, Repair, and Service Call work orders, associated reports, and approving for invoicing when complete.</p>
<p>After an expected transitionary period, our Inspection and Service departments have overall recognized efficiencies, especially in submitting documents to their clients. The biggest improvement that I appreciated, during my time as Operations Manager for the Vancouver Inspections Division (up until end of 2021), was the ability to oversee the status of the all work we were performing.</p>
<p>Tracking paper work orders and reports for a large team was a challenge and the system really helped with this, allowing more time for other tasks, and greater transparency across all steps of the service provided.</p>
<p>Not without its hiccups, Mozaik and the associated service modules in PolyApps have jumped our teams into the present and have nearly eliminated paperwork. With any technology, there are bugs that need to be reported and fixed by the release of new software versions. The team managing the back-end of Mozaik is often making changes to accommodate code requirements and usability of the system for the field and office staff. Recent improvements include, the addition of VESDA, Kitchen Suppression, and 5+ Year Sprinkler Reports, as well as the Mozaik Phone Application which is primary used to view upcoming schedule and submit timesheets.</p>
<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tatyana Nikolova, </strong><strong>Inspection Report Supervisor</strong>: <em>“I have been using Mozaik for more than 3 years and I can say that it is at the same time a novelty, a challenge and an adaptation. For this project to work we have to leave old habits behind and embark on a new system that is like a human being – it grows and develops every day. It is a great honor and privilege for me to have the opportunity to be part of such a global change for the company across Canada.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Mélanie Lavergne, Quality/Environment Coordinator</strong>: <em>“The new system allows us to meet the quality objectives we have set for ourselves, such as sending the report to the customer within 30 days of the inspection. In addition, the various controls established allow us to limit errors and thus improving the customer experience.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Eric Lewis, Sprinkler Fitter</strong>: <em>“We have been using Mozaik now for a couple of months and my first impression of it is that I like it much better then how we were doing things before.  There was and still is a bit of a learning curve and a few glitches here and there but I love the fact that I don’t need to carry anymore paperwork around with me (with the exception of [City specific] backflow reports).  I like how the screen is much bigger than [the Toughbook], I like the voice dictation a lot especially for fire extinguisher serial numbers.  I would like to see the material search maybe get a bit easier because I’ve had a hard time finding some materials even when implementing the advanced search option.  I would also like to see the individual city backflow reports somehow implemented so I don’t have to use a paper report and to submit it, I would just like to see the entire thing be paperless.  Overall I really like Mozaik and besides a few new learning curves I feel it’s made my job a little easier.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Jyotishna Naidu, Dispatcher</strong>: <em>“I’ve been using Mozaik for over a year and I love the tools it has provided me with. I don’t use it as much as others in my department but it’s very efficient and sometimes straight forward. As for the dispatch screen at times it can be slow or hard to remove jobs as it gives you a lot of error messages but a function I would love to see is who has moved jobs around as it’s always an issue when there is a lot of others that use the dispatch screen. I do like all the improvements with time reservations and when you send a customer an email and the reminder functions.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>This project has been a massive investment for the company and we are nearing the finish line to implement the system across all of our branches. I’m really proud to be involved in seeing this project though and supporting our teams through the process.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you across all of our branches for your dedication to prepare for the implementations, your openness to learn, and especially your commitment to use the systems in the way they have been intended. Your patience with the corporate services team when support is needed is also very much appreciated!</p>
