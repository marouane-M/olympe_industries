										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An expert fire alarm technician leaves his mark at Viking Fire Protection!</h2>
<p>At Viking Fire Protection, we believe in showcasing our dedicated workforce. We are proud to be the employer of choice for the industry&#8217;s most experienced and knowledgeable fire alarm professionals. Because we value our exceptional team, we are dedicating a special segment of our blog, the &#8220;Join the Fire Protection Best!&#8221; series, to highlight that the best specialists, recognized across Canada, work at <a href="https://vikingfire.ca/">Viking Fire Protection</a>.</p>
<p>For this article, we have chosen to highlight a senior technician, and expert electrician, working with our Viking Fire Protection team in Montreal: Jaafar Kobaa, due to his commitment and integrity in the practice of his profession.</p>
<div id="attachment_8776" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8776" class="wp-image-8776" title="Expert fire alarm technician and electrician Viking Montreal" src="https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jaafar2.jpg" alt="Expert fire alarm technician and electrician Viking Montreal" width="710" height="896" srcset="https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jaafar2.jpg 586w, https://vikingfire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jaafar2-238x300.jpg 238w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8776" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Jaafar Kobaa at the Viking Fire Protection Office, in Montreal</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Montreal team for their support and collaboration throughout my journey at Viking. Your expertise, mentorship, and solidarity have been essential in my professional development, and I am grateful to be a part of an exceptional crew.&#8221;</em> &#8211; Jaafar Kobaa</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mastering the Trade: Jaafar Kobaa&#8217;s Training and Work Experience Leading to Expertise</h3>
<p>Over the past 12 years, Jaafar has worked as a fire alarm technician. He has gained extensive experience in the installation, inspection, and commissioning of fire alarm systems.</p>
<p>His outstanding professional skills, quality of work, and customer service are highly appreciated by his clients. Following the completion of several fire alarm projects, clients have expressed great satisfaction with the quality of his work.</p>
<p>Before fully dedicating himself to the fire protection field and pursuing fire alarm training, Jaafar gained valuable experience as an electrician in the industrial sector. This prior experience allowed him to acquire skills and knowledge that have enriched his current expertise in fire alarm systems.</p>
<p>Having completed studies in electrical engineering in Morocco, where he ranked first in his class, Jaafar further developed his competence and mastery in Quebec, to become an expert fire alarm technician.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jaafar has accumulated an impressive list of diplomas and certifications, leading, among other things, to his certified fire alarm technician (<a href="https://www.cfaa.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFAA</a>) and Red Seal construction electrician (CCQ) credentials.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Red Seal designation is a mark of excellence among employers in Canada, indicating that the electrician has successfully performed in interprovincial exams, mastering the national standard practices, recognized by the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship (CCDA).</p>
<p>Within his department, Jaafar <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">is considered the go-to person to tackle the most challenging mandates, and for managing multiple large projects simultaneously. </span>He is always receptive when it comes to taking on the responsibility of training new technicians. Clearly, his adaptability to the various changes in the fire protection industry is one of his strongest qualities.</p>
<p>Regarding the following article, just before it was published, Jaafar commented: &#8220;I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire team for their support and collaboration throughout my journey at Viking. Your expertise, mentorship, and teamwork have been essential to my professional development, and I am grateful to be part of such an exceptional team.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Viking Fire Protection, we believe in showcasing our dedicated workforce. We are proud to be the employer of choice for the industry‚Äôs most experienced and talented fire protection professionals. Because we value our exceptional specialists, across Canada, we dedicate a segment of our blog, the ‚ÄúJoin the Fire Protection Best!‚Äù series, to share their unique stories.</p>
<div>
<div class="ivm-image-view-model pvs-entity__image ">
<p>For this article, we have chosen to highlight a Technical Sales Representative at our Viking Regina branch: Dan Clark. This story is about an exceptional athlete whose journey from the world of professional football to fire alarm sales has been nothing short of impressive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>A Veteran Offensive Lineman joins the Viking Fire Alarm Sales Team</h2>
<p>In the Viking Regina office, one of our technical sales reps actually won the 2013 Grey Cup title: his name is Dan R. Clark. Dan&#8217;s transition from a career in professional football, as an offensive lineman for the Saskatchewan Roughriders, to<a href="https://vikingfire.ca/solutions/fire-alarm/"> fire alarm</a> sales has been truly remarkable.</p>
<p>When Dan joined the Regina team, he dove headfirst into his role, setting an ambitious goal for himself: to become ‚Äúthe best fire alarm salesperson in the province.‚Äù His unwavering dedication, along with his enthusiastic team spirit, has already set him on that path. Dan‚Äôs quick success stems from his relentless drive, commitment to learning, and the outstanding attitude he brings to every task. Winning the Grey Cup and making his first touchdown are among his best memories in playing professional football, having already achieved these memorable milestones, he‚Äôs now striving for new heights in his sales career.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Dan came on board, we had almost no requests for fire alarm pricing. But Dan immediately hit the streets, reaching out to every potential client he could. His outgoing personality and strong customer service commitment have already yielded results, with new pricing requests coming in daily. Dan has built genuine relationships with electrical contractors and suppliers in our area, leading to a steady increase in his sales numbers. Remarkably, he even helped us secure several large-scale projects‚Äîan impressive feat for anyone, let alone someone so new to the field.&#8221;-Mike Monette, District Manager</p>
<p>In his past football life, <a href="https://www.riderville.com/tag/dan-clark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Clark</a> played with the Riders from 2009 to 2022. He was CFL all-star, <span class="s1">named the Roughriders Most Outstanding Lineman, </span>and shared in the Riders‚Äô 45-23 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 2013 Grey Cup game at old Mosaic Stadium.</p>

<h2>Growing Expertise in Fire Alarm Systems</h2>
<p>Dan‚Äôs path to becoming a leading fire alarm salesperson is built on the strong foundation of his 13+ year sports career. Transitioning from professional athlete to an industry specialist, Dan has demonstrated an incredible ability to learn, adapt and grow. His knowledge expands daily through self-study and support from his Viking Fire team, especially his colleagues in British Columbia and Alberta. In particular Bob Kerr, Mike McIntyre, and Paul Huntington who provided mentorship and support to help Dan develop his expertise.</p>
<h3>&#8220;My favorite part of the job is knowing that I‚Äôm helping to keep people safe. It‚Äôs incredibly rewarding to provide solutions that protect lives and property. Plus, I enjoy meeting new people and building relationships with clients.&#8221;-Dan R. Clark, Technical Sales Rep.</h3>
<p>Which achievement is Dan most proud of so far at Viking Fire? He answered with the following: &#8220;I‚Äôm most proud of how quickly I adapted to the fire alarm industry despite having no prior background. Learning the technical aspects and regulations has been challenging, but I embraced the challenge. It‚Äôs been a steep learning curve, but having the support and guidance of my colleagues has made a significant impact. Their expertise and encouragement have been invaluable in guiding my career with Viking Fire&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to his district manager, Dan‚Äôs eager-to-learn attitude, coupled with his commitment to excellence, makes him an ideal student. His determination to stay on top of industry trends and product knowledge is apparent in every client interaction, ensuring Viking Fire clients receive the most informed service possible.</p>

<h2>A Lasting Impact on Team Culture</h2>
<p>Since he started working at Viking Regina, Dan&#8217;s energy and work ethic have had a lasting impact on his office&#8217;s culture: &#8220;Dan‚Äôs biggest contributions to our team are his amazing team-first attitude and strong work ethic. There is no task Dan will say no to. His priority has always been to do what is best for the group. He helps foster a supportive, collaborative, and positive environment in our office. It‚Äôs a pleasure working with Dan every day.&#8221; &#8211; Mike Monette, District Manager</p>
<p>Clark‚Äôs contributions have not been limited to the field. He was among the most active players in the community and has embraced his role as an ambassador.¬† In fact, he was the 2022 Jake Gaudaur Veterans‚Äô Award Winner: this recognition is awarded to a Canadian player who demonstrates the attributes of Canada‚Äôs veterans: Strength, perseverance, courage, comradeship and contribution to Canadian communities. At the awards ceremony, the CFL Commissioner, Randy Ambrosie, commented the following about Dan: ‚ÄúHe stands tall in the Riders locker room as a veteran and as a leader, and every bit as important is what he stands for in the community. He is an incredible role model to his teammates, the entire league and all Canadians.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>The following Rider Radio video is one of Dan&#8217;s latest interviews where he discusses his CFL retirement and mentions his new fire alarm sales career:</em></p>

<p>For this article, we have chosen to highlight an Operations Manager at our Viking Fire Ottawa branch: Sonya Robinson. This story is about an exceptional professional whose journey epitomizes growth, expertise, and unwavering commitment, as a woman, in a male-dominant industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Sonya is a dedicated mother of two teenagers, balancing family life with her passion for fastpitch softball, where she excels as both a first baseman and shortstop. Her love for the game is matched by her commitment to professional excellence, recently being elected as a Director for the Eastern Ontario Chapter of the Canadian Fire Alarm Association (CFAA). This new role reflects her leadership and drive, qualities she brings to all aspects of her life, from the softball field to her professional contributions in fire safety.</p>

<p>In an interview published by the <a href="https://www.casa-firesprinkler.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CASA</a> Journal, concerning her career in the construction industry she stated: &#8220;Having a seat at the table in the fire protection industry, alongside both men and women, is a significant step towards greater diversity and inclusion. It not only enriches the industry with a wider range of perspectives and talents but also sends a powerful message that anyone, regardless of gender, can contribute meaningfully to fire and life safety efforts.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Climb up the Fire Protection Ladder</h2>
<p>Sonya&#8217;s work experience in the fire protection industry began as a coordinator, and with the mentorship and support of her manager, she advanced her career up to a supervisor position.</p>
<p>At Viking Fire, she began working as an Inspections Supervisor: this role helped to shape her understanding of the field, allowing her to develop a meticulous approach to inspections and a deep appreciation for the critical nature of fire protection services. A few years later, Sonya was promoted to her current role: Operations Manager, for the service and inspections department of the fire alarm division.</p>
<p>Part of the foundation for her career was laid at the Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology, where she acquired a Certificate in Business Administration and Management, and, more recently she completed a management program, which provided a solid grounding in business principles, critical thinking, and management strategies: instrumental in her professional achievements.</p>
<h3>A Journey of Passion and Purpose: Insights from an Operations Manager at Viking Ottawa</h3>

<p>Sonya is proud that her career in fire protection, of over twenty years and counting, enables her to make a positive impact by helping clients ensure the safety of their properties, communities, and buildings occupants. The sense of purpose derived from keeping people and property safe is a major motivator. Knowing that her work at Viking Fire directly contributes to the safety and security of the Ottawa community, clients, and their assets, gives her a deep sense of fulfillment.</p>
<p>In an interview published in the 2nd edition of the¬†<a href="https://www.casa-firesprinkler.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CASA</a> Outstanding Women of The Canadian Fire Sprinkler Industry, Sonya mentioned that the opportunity to collaborate with professionals from diverse trades, including electrical contractors, AHJs (Authorities Having Jurisdiction), engineers, and manufacturers, enriched her work experience. &#8220;This cross-functional collaboration not only broadened my knowledge but also enriched my work experience, as I learned to navigate different perspectives and expertise in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sonya is convinced that building strong relationships with clients and colleagues is fundamental in her line of work: &#8220;What drives me to get up and do this every day is the sense of pride I have in my team and the journey we are on together. Seeing the growth and success of our team is an ongoing source of motivation,&#8221; she pointed out.</p>

We are proud to be the employer of choice for the industry&#8217;s most experienced and knowledgeable fire protection professionals. Because we value our exceptional team, we are dedicating a special segment of our blog, the &#8220;Join the Fire Protection Best!&#8221; series, to highlight that the best specialists, recognized across Canada, work at <a href="https://vikingfire.ca/">Viking Fire Protection</a>.</p>
<p>For this article, we have chosen to highlight a Senior Technical Sales Representative, working with the Viking Fire team in Ottawa: Bernard St-Aubin. With over 16 years of hands-on experience in field installation and project supervision, Bernard has carved a niche for himself in the fire protection industry. His career path, from a field expert to an experienced technical sales representative is a testament to his dedication, knowledge, and versatility.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I love working on complicated projects: they give me the opportunity to pore over fire industry books and broaden my knowledge and expertise. When Viking colleagues, from the service, engineering, or inspection departments need solutions, for complex and critical fire protection mandates, they can rely on my solution-driven mindset and eagerness to assist them&#8221; &#8211; Bernard St-Aubin</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Truck Driver, Sprinkler Fitter, then Promoted to¬†Senior Technical Sales Rep</h3>
<p>From the early days as a truck driver to becoming an expert in the fire protection trade, his career trajectory is marked by continuous learning, and a passion for the field.</p>
<p>Starting with his trades studies: Bernard&#8217;s high grades reflected a deep understanding of the material, while a spirit of collaboration shone through in his willingness to assist classmates. This dedication was recognized with an award and a certificate for achieving the highest scholastic grades in Advanced trade school.</p>
<p>Then, as a licensed and <a href="https://www.red-seal.ca/eng/w.2lc.4m.2.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Seal</a> sprinkler fitter, Bernard&#8217;s savoir-faire began with an apprenticeship that quickly showcased a knack for learning and adaptability. This hands-on experience included installing fire pumps, deluge systems, foam systems, pre-action systems, and clean agent systems. Each project added layers of practical knowledge and technical skill.</p>
<h3>Work Experience Leading to Fire Protection Expertise</h3>
<p>When his career at Viking Fire began, 7 years ago, Bernard worked as an inspection&#8217;s supervisor. His comprehensive knowledge of CanUlc 537 and fire alarm inspections ensured the highest standards of safety and compliance.</p>
<p>Now as a valued technical sales rep, Bernard quotes maintenance and fit-ups for projects of all sizes. He also provides project management and technical support for inspections, service, and engineering departments. His explicit knowledge of Automatic Fire Protection codes ensures that every project meets stringent safety standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his extensive experience, commitment to teaching and mentorship make him a valuable asset. Colleagues benefit from immediate technical expertise, whether it involves code-related questions, installation methods, or troubleshooting complex issues.</p>
<p>In fact, one of Bernard&#8217;s standout qualities is his passion for problem-solving. Dropping everything to assist colleagues, tackling technical challenges head-on, and finding innovative solutions are not just part of the job; they are the aspects he most enjoys.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Bernard&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit, and solution-driven approach continue to set him apart as an innovator in his field. His Algonquin heritage shines through in his work, and personal life, for example in his spiritual practices, and his passion for hunting and fishing.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, t<span tabindex="0" role="tooltip"><span class="c5aZPb" tabindex="0" role="button" data-enable-toggle-animation="true" data-extra-container-classes="ZLo7Eb" data-hover-hide-delay="1000" data-hover-open-delay="500" data-send-open-event="true" data-theme="0" data-width="250" data-ved="2ahUKEwjbrfn-hOiGAxUXpIkEHZnJA38QmpgGegQIGBAD"><span class="JPfdse" data-bubble-link="" data-segment-text="Algonquin">he Algonquin</span></span></span> Philosophy is: <em>Remain close to the Great Spirit. Show great respect for your fellow beings. Work together for the benefit of all Mankind.
